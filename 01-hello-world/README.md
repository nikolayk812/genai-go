# 01-hello-world

Contains a simple example of using a language model to generate text.

## Libraries Involved

- `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go`: A library for running Docker containers for integration tests.
- `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/ollama`: A module for running Ollama language models using Testcontainers.
- `github.com/tmc/langchaingo`: A library for interacting with language models.
- `github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/ollama`: A specific implementation of the language model interface for Ollama.

## Code Explanation

The code in `main.go` sets up and runs a containerized Ollama language model using Testcontainers, then uses the model to generate text based on a given prompt.

### Main Functions

- `main()`: The entry point of the application. It calls the `run()` function and logs any errors.
- `run()`: The main logic of the application. It performs the following steps:
  1. Runs an Ollama container using Testcontainers for Golang. The image used is `ilopezluna/llama3.2:0.3.13-1b`, loading the `llama3.2:1b` model.
  2. Retrieves the connection string for the running container.
  3. Creates a new Ollama language model instance.
  4. Defines the content to be generated by the language model.
  5. Generates the content and prints it to the console.

## Running the Example

To run the example, navigate to the `01-hello-world` directory and run the following command:

```sh
go run .
```

The application will start a containerized Ollama language model and generate text based on the provided prompt. The generated text will be displayed in the console.

Here are three short bullet points explaining why Go is awesome:

• **Concise and Efficient**: Go's syntax and design make it one of the most concise and efficient programming languages, allowing developers to write code that is both elegant and performant.

• **Goroutines and Channels**: Go's built-in concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels, enable developers to write scalable and concurrent systems with ease, making it a popular choice for cloud-native applications.

• **Lack of Garbage Collection**: Go's focus on memory management through its ownership system and garbage collection mechanism allows developers to write low-level, performance-critical code that is free from the overhead of traditional garbage collectors.%
